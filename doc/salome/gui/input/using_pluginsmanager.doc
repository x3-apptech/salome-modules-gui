\section S1_SALOMEPLUGINS Objectives

The SALOME python plugin manager allows the end user to extend the
graphic interface of SALOME with custom functions written as python
modules. The screenshots below show the example of a tool that creates
a mesh from a set of geometrical parameters with the support of
simple graphical interface:

The default menu for plugins is "Tool->Extensions":

In this example, the plugin provides a small interface to input the
parameters (not provided by the plugin manager):
\image html SALOME_pythonplugins_dialog.png

Then creates the mesh model:
\image html SALOME_pythonplugins_result.png

In this example, the end user has to write:

-# the python script that creates the mesh from the parameters, using
   the GEOM and SMESH python interface, as in a classic use case,
-# the dialog box in PyQt to input the parameters,
-# the file salome_plugins.py that declares the plugins.

This page explains only the last point.

\section S2_SALOMEPLUGINS Principles

The general form of the file salome_plugins.py is:

\code
import salome_pluginsmanager

# Creation of the plugin
def myplugin1(context):
   ...
   # Here is the code of the plugin myplugin1
   ...

def myplugin2(context):
   ...
   # Here is the code of the plugin myplugin2
   ...

# Declaration of the plugins to the pluginsmanager
salome_pluginsmanager.AddFunction('My plugin n°1', 'This action runs the plugin n°1', myplugin1)
salome_pluginsmanager.AddFunction('My plugin n°2', 'This action runs the plugin n°2', myplugin2)
...
\endcode

The procedure is to define a function that implements the plugin, and
to declare this function to the plugins manager. The implementation
can be very variable. It is advisable to consider this function as a
proxy to your code that you can manage in a python package
installed in the standard SALOME python directories.

In this code, the variable "context" is automatically transmitted by
the pluginmanager when you request the plugin. This context provides
you with at least the following attributes:

\code
activeStudy = context.study
salomegui = context.sg
\endcode

Once written, this script salome_plugin.py has to be moved to a
specific place on your filesystem where SALOME is programmed to search
for plugins. The possible directories are (in search order):

-# The directory <*_ROOT_DIR>/share/salome/plugins/<module_name>, when
   this plugin is developped in the framework of a SALOME module
   (<*_ROOT_DIR> is the root installation directory of the module, and
   <module_name> is the name of the module in low letters).
-# The directory ~/.config/salome/Plugins for personnal end user
   plugins.
-# Any path in the shell variable SALOME_PLUGINS_PATH (each path must be
   separated by a comma ":" for unix and ";" for windows). This
   variable should be set and exported before running the SALOME application.

\section S3_SALOMEPLUGINS A complete example

Suppose that you write a SALOME script that creates a trihedron for each of
your studies (a simple and standard SALOME script, that every end user
is capable to write if he reads the documentation and follows the
training course):

\code
# Intialize the geompy factory with the active study
import salome
import GEOM
from salome.geom import geomBuilder
geompy = geomBuilder.New(salome.myStudy)

# Create the objects
Vx = geompy.MakeVectorDXDYDZ(10, 0, 0)
Vy = geompy.MakeVectorDXDYDZ(0, 10, 0)
Vz = geompy.MakeVectorDXDYDZ(0, 0, 10)
origin = geompy.MakeVertex(0, 0, 0)

# Register the objects in the active study
geompy.addToStudy( Vx, "Vx" )
geompy.addToStudy( Vy, "Vy" )
geompy.addToStudy( Vz, "Vz" )
geompy.addToStudy( origin, "origin" )
\endcode

The job consists in creating the file salome_plugins.py as follows:

\code
import salome_pluginsmanager
def trihedron(context):
    import GEOM
    from salome.geom import geomBuilder
    geompy = geomBuilder.New(salome.myStudy)
    # Intialize the geompy factory with the active study
    activeStudy = context.study
    geompy.init_geom(activeStudy)
    # Create the objects
    Vx = geompy.MakeVectorDXDYDZ(10, 0, 0)
    Vy = geompy.MakeVectorDXDYDZ(0, 10, 0)
    Vz = geompy.MakeVectorDXDYDZ(0, 0, 10)
    origin = geompy.MakeVertex(0, 0, 0)
    # Register the objects in the active study
    geompy.addToStudy( Vx, "Vx" )
    geompy.addToStudy( Vy, "Vy" )
    geompy.addToStudy( Vz, "Vz" )
    geompy.addToStudy( origin, "origin" )

# Register the function in the plugin manager
salome_pluginsmanager.AddFunction('O,Vx,Vy,Vz',
                                  'Creates the trihedron',
                                  trihedron)

\endcode

Move this script in the directory
~/.config/salome/Plugins, run SALOME and enjoy your new function.

\section S4_SALOMEPLUGINS How to select an object of the object browser

Sometimes it can be useful to retrieve an object of the object browser to perform
an action on it, for example, to select a mesh and display some information related to it.

Some important methods and objects to use are as follows:
-# context.sg.getObjectBrowser():  to connect the signal event
                                  `selectionChanged()` to a custom slot
-# context.salome.sg.getAllSelected(): to get the list of selected object
                                       in the object browser
-# objId = context.salome.sg.getSelected(0):
  to get the first selected object in the object browser
-# salomeObj = context.salome.study.FindObjectID(objId).GetObject():
  to retrieve the salome object from selection. It can be a GEOM, SMESH, or any
  other module object.

  If it is a mesh, then it is possible to call methods of the SMESH::SMESH_Mesh interface
  on the object, for example GetShapeToMesh().
  If it is not a mesh, this call will raise an exception.
  So it is possible to write the code retrieving the shape a mesh is built on in the following way:
\code
mesh = None
try:
  shape = salomeObj.GetShapeToMesh()
except:
  print "The selection is not a mesh"
\endcode

An example of those methods is available with the demo examples.
See the next chapter \ref S5_SALOMEPLUGINS.

\section S5_SALOMEPLUGINS Other examples

The GUI module provides you with some basic demo examples located in
the directory src/SalomeApp/pluginsdemo of the source space and
installed in the directory $GUI_ROOT_DIR/share/salome/plugins/gui/demo.

\note These examples are automatically installed when you install the GUI
but are not activated. To activate the plugins, edit the file
$GUI_ROOT_DIR/share/salome/plugins/gui/demo/salome_plugins.py and turn the
variable DEMO_IS_ACTIVATED to True.

The demo examples are:
-# \b trihedron: create a trihedron and display it with fit on the size
-# \b tube_shapewithgui: create a geom object from parameters given by a
   dialog box.
-# \b tube_meshwithgui: create a mesh object from parameters given by a
   dialog box. This illustrates that a plugin can work with more than
   one SALOME module.
-# \b tube_shapewithguiAndPreview: same than tube_shapewithgui but with
   an additionnal preview function (button apply in the dialog box).
-# \b runSalomeShellSession: run a SALOME prepared shell session in a
   xterm.
-# \b minmax: computes the min and max values of a control on a selected mesh.
  \note This plugin is available in the SMESH module only. To activate it, edit
  the file $GUI_ROOT_DIR/share/salome/plugins/gui/demo/smesh_plugins.py and turn the variable
  DEMO_IS_ACTIVATED to True.
