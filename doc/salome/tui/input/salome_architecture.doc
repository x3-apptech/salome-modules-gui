&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

\b SALOME architecture is based on \b CORBA technology using
distributed system model of applications.
\b SALOME combines several software components, which are built in such a way that it allows to
integrate solvers and existing meshing algorithms along with the
specification of physical properties for a given domain. The
originality of this approach is that the various components must
cooperate dynamically and be configurable.

<br>SALOME platform integrates a number of modules each having its own function:
<ul>
<li>\b KERNEL :  provides a common shell for all components, which can be integrated into the SALOME platform.
<li>\b GUI : provides visual representation: basic widgets, viewers
etc. Third party modules optionally can have GUI, but in any case they always connected with KERNEL.
<li>\b Geometry :  facilitates construction and optimization of geometrical models using a wide range of  CAD functions. 
<li>\b Mesh :  generates meshes on geometrical models previously created or imported by the Geometry component.
<li>\b ParaVis :  performs data visualization and post-processing.
<li>\b MED :  allows to work with MED files.
</ul>

Salome architecture takes the concept of multitier client/server to its natural conclusion. The
distributed system model exposes all functionality of the application
as objects, each of which can use any of the services provided by
other objects in the system, or even objects in other systems. The
architecture can also blur the distinction between "client" and
"server" because the client components can also create objects that
behave in server-like roles. This architecture provides the ultimate
in flexibility.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The distributed system architecture achieves its flexibility by
encouraging (or enforcing) the definition of specific component
interfaces. The interface of a component specifies to other components
what services are offered by that component and how they are used. As
long as the interface of a component remains constant, that
component's implementation can change dramatically without affecting
other components.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All software components (Geometry, Mesh...) integrated into
\b SALOME platform  implement predefined interfaces. Each component
provides data for the \b SALOME study in a form of links (stored in
the Study) to the specific data created and stored in the
component. All components represent \b CORBA servers and it allows to
run them on different host stations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is equally possible to create engine-independent modules. These
modules may not use CORBA at all, and can have internal data structure
which can be written in pure C++ (or python). Such modules are located
inside SALOME GUI process and from the point of view of the end user
have no difference with standard components. Such modules not using
the standard tools of SALOME platform are defined on a special
separated level named CAM. CAM component is the basis for new SALOME
GUI and contains all basic functionality for working with modules
(loading; saving, closing, customization of toolbar and menu).


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another fundamental piece of the \b SALOME architecture is the use of
the Interface Definition Language (IDL). IDL, which specifies
interfaces between CORBA components, is instrumental in ensuring
CORBA's language independence. Because interfaces described in IDL can
be mapped to any programming language, CORBA applications and
components are thus independent of the language(s) used to implement
them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The architecture of this all-inclusive
platform for numerical components  responds to the following
objectives:
<ol>
<li>\b Flexibility :  the creation and modification of computation
schemes must be easy. The developer must have easy access to all
modeling parameters to create domain-specific tools adapted to new
situations or to test new numerical algorithms. SALOME allows
integration and implementation of numerical and physical components
derived from existing code.</li>
<li>\b Productivity :  the implementation of code is simple for the
user and the reuse of components (within other environments for
macro-components) is noticeably facilitated.</li>
<li> \b Performance :\b  SALOME is able to more finely simulate
phenomena that is more complex in scale and in physical coupling
requirements. \b SALOME economically exploits the performance of used
machines (massively parallel processors, PC clusters, etc).</li>
<li> \b Expandability:  on the one hand, software technologies and
physical architectures evolve rapidly compared to the development
time, validation and use of a scientific application while on the
other hand, the development of a database model adapted to the
totality of exchanges between components can be achieved
incrementally. \b SALOME  is able to easily follow these
developments.</li>
